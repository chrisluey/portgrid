# portgrid

Portgrid is a social network platform for developers' personal projects. Having a feed for primarily project updates and collaboration opportunities would give developers a better experience if they want their personal projects to thrive. Projects are becoming more important for employers and having an easy-to-use, aesthetically pleasing platform could give developers an edge in the job market. This application was made with Vue.js.
